GAPIC Templates
===============

This directory is intended for inserting handwritten files
into autogenerated directories (see `owlbot.py`). In particular,
it is needed for inserting the definition of `OneofMessage` into
`google/cloud/bigtable/admin_v2/types` to prevent circular import
issues with having something in that directory import from
`google/cloud/bigtable/admin_v2/overlay`.
