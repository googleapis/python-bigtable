# This directory and all its subdirectories are the only handwritten
# components of the otherwise autogenerated google/cloud/bigtable/admin_v2.
# The purpose of the overlay directory is to add additional functionality to
# the autogenerated library while preserving its developer experience. These
# handwritten additions currently consist of the following:
#
#  1. TODO: Document final GcRule design choice here
#  2. An LRO class for restore_table that exposes an Operation for
#     OptimizeRestoreTable, if that LRO exists.
#  3. New methods (wait_for_consistency and wait_for_replication) that return
#     a polling future class for automatically polling check_consistency.
#
# This directory is structured to mirror that of a typical autogenerated library (e.g.
# services/types subdirectories), and the aforementioned handwritten additions are
# currently implemented as either types under overlay/types or in methods in an overwritten
# client class under overlay/services.
