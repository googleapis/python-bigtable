    """A MutationsBatcher is used in batch cases where the number of mutations
    is large or unknown. It will store :class:`DirectRow` in memory until one of the
    size limits is reached, or an explicit call to :func:`flush()` is performed. When
    a flush event occurs, the :class:`DirectRow` in memory will be sent to Cloud
    Bigtable. Batching mutations is more efficient than sending individual
    request.

    This class is not suited for usage in systems where each mutation
    must be guaranteed to be sent, since calling mutate may only result in an
    in-memory change. In a case of a system crash, any :class:`DirectRow` remaining in
    memory will not necessarily be sent to the service, even after the
    completion of the :func:`mutate()` method.

    Note on thread safety: The same :class:`MutationBatcher` cannot be shared by multiple end-user threads.

    :type table: class

    :type flush_count: int
    :param flush_count: (Optional) Max number of rows to flush. If it
        reaches the max number of rows it calls finish_batch() to mutate the
        current row batch. Default is FLUSH_COUNT (1000 rows).

    :type max_row_bytes: int
    :param max_row_bytes: (Optional) Max number of row mutations size to
        flush. If it reaches the max number of row mutations size it calls
        finish_batch() to mutate the current row batch. Default is MAX_ROW_BYTES
        (5 MB).

    :type flush_interval: float
    :param flush_interval: (Optional) The interval (in seconds) between asynchronous flush.
        Default is 1 second.
