    """A MutationsBatcher is used in batch cases where the number of mutations
    is large or unknown. It will store DirectRows in memory until one of the
    size limits is reached, or an explicit call to flush() is performed. When
    a flush event occurs, the DirectRows in memory will be sent to Cloud
    Bigtable. Batching mutations is more efficient than sending individual
    request.

    This class is not suited for usage in systems where each mutation
    needs to guaranteed to be sent, since calling mutate may only result in an
    in-memory change. In a case of a system crash, any DirectRows remaining in
    memory will not necessarily be sent to the service, even after the
    completion of the mutate() method.

    capability of asynchronous, parallel RPCs.
