class RowFilter(proto.Message):
    r"""Takes a row as input and produces an alternate view of the row based
    on specified rules. For example, a RowFilter might trim down a row
    to include just the cells from columns matching a given regular
    expression, or might return all the cells of a row but not their
    values. More complicated filters can be composed out of these
    components to express requests such as, "within every column of a
    particular family, give just the two most recent cells which are
    older than timestamp X."

    There are two broad categories of RowFilters (true filters and
    transformers), as well as two ways to compose simple filters into
    more complex ones (chains and interleaves). They work as follows:

    -  True filters alter the input row by excluding some of its cells
       wholesale from the output row. An example of a true filter is the
       ``value_regex_filter``, which excludes cells whose values don't
       match the specified pattern. All regex true filters use RE2
       syntax (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) in raw byte
       mode (RE2::Latin1), and are evaluated as full matches. An
       important point to keep in mind is that ``RE2(.)`` is equivalent
       by default to ``RE2([^\n])``, meaning that it does not match
       newlines. When attempting to match an arbitrary byte, you should
       therefore use the escape sequence ``\C``, which may need to be
       further escaped as ``\\C`` in your client language.

    -  Transformers alter the input row by changing the values of some
       of its cells in the output, without excluding them completely.
       Currently, the only supported transformer is the
       ``strip_value_transformer``, which replaces every cell's value
       with the empty string.

    -  Chains and interleaves are described in more detail in the
       RowFilter.Chain and RowFilter.Interleave documentation.

    The total serialized size of a RowFilter message must not exceed
    20480 bytes, and RowFilters may not be nested within each other (in
    Chains or Interleaves) to a depth of more than 20.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other

            Despite being excluded by the qualifier filter, a copy of
            every cell that reaches the sink is present in the final
            result.

            As with an
            [Interleave][google.bigtable.v2.RowFilter.Interleave],
            duplicate cells are possible, and appear in an unspecified
            mutual order. In this case we have a duplicate with column
            "A:B" and timestamp 2, because one copy passed through the
            all filter while the other was passed through the label and
            sink. Note that one copy has label "foo", while the other
            does not.

            Note that, since row keys can contain arbitrary bytes, the
            ``\C`` escape sequence must be used if a true wildcard is
            desired. The ``.`` character will not match the new line

        family_name_regex_filter (str):
            Matches only cells from columns whose families satisfy the

            contain the ``:`` character, even if it is not being used as
            a literal. Note that, since column families cannot contain
            the new line character ``\n``, it is sufficient to use ``.``
            as a full wildcard when matching column family names.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``filter``.
        column_qualifier_regex_filter (bytes):
            Matches only cells from columns whose qualifiers satisfy the
            given RE2 regex. Note that, since column qualifiers can
            contain arbitrary bytes, the ``\C`` escape sequence must be
            used if a true wildcard is desired. The ``.`` character will
            not match the new line character ``\n``, which may be

            arbitrary bytes, the ``\C`` escape sequence must be used if
            a true wildcard is desired. The ``.`` character will not
            match the new line character ``\n``, which may be present in

            present, as is possible when using an

            when using an Interleave, each copy of the cell

        cells_per_column_limit_filter (int):

            example, if N=2, this filter would match column ``foo:bar``
            at timestamps 10 and 9, skip all earlier cells in
            ``foo:bar``, and then begin matching again in column
            ``foo:bar2``. If duplicate cells are present, as is possible
            when using an Interleave, each copy of the cell is counted
            separately.

        apply_label_transformer (str):
            Applies the given label to all cells in the output row. This
            allows the client to determine which results were produced
            from which part of the filter.

            Values must be at most 15 characters in length, and match
            the RE2 pattern ``[a-z0-9\\-]+``

            Due to a technical limitation, it is not currently possible
            to apply multiple labels to a cell. As a result, a Chain may
            have no more than one sub-filter which contains a
            ``apply_label_transformer``. It is okay for an Interleave to
            contain multiple ``apply_label_transformers``, as they will
            be applied to separate copies of the input. This may be
            relaxed in the future.
