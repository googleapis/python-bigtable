            A collection of a row's contents as part of
            the read request.
        last_scanned_row_key (bytes):
            Optionally the server might return the row
            key of the last row it has scanned.  The client
            can use this to construct a more efficient retry
            request if needed: any row keys or portions of
            ranges less than this row key can be dropped
            from the request. This is primarily useful for
            cases where the server has read a lot of data
            that was filtered out since the last committed
            row key, allowing the client to skip that work
            on a retry.
        request_stats (google.cloud.bigtable_v2.types.RequestStats):
            If requested, provide enhanced query performance statistics.
            The semantics dictate:

            -  request_stats is empty on every (streamed) response,
               except
            -  request_stats has non-empty information after all chunks
               have been streamed, where the ReadRowsResponse message
               only contains request_stats.

               -  For example, if a read request would have returned an
                  empty response instead a single ReadRowsResponse is
                  streamed with empty chunks and request_stats filled.

            Visually, response messages will stream as follows: ... ->
            {chunks: [...]} -> {chunks: [], request_stats: {...}}
            \_\ **/ \_**\ \__________/ Primary response Trailer of

        Attributes:

                The row key for this chunk of data.  If the
                row key is empty, this CellChunk is a
                continuation of the same row as the previous
                CellChunk in the response stream, even if that
                CellChunk was in a previous ReadRowsResponse
                message.
            family_name (google.protobuf.wrappers_pb2.StringValue):
                The column family name for this chunk of data. If this
                message is not present this CellChunk is a continuation of
                the same column family as the previous CellChunk. The empty
                string can occur as a column family name in a response so
                clients must check explicitly for the presence of this
                message, not just for ``family_name.value`` being non-empty.
            qualifier (google.protobuf.wrappers_pb2.BytesValue):
                The column qualifier for this chunk of data. If this message
                is not present, this CellChunk is a continuation of the same
                column as the previous CellChunk. Column qualifiers may be
                empty so clients must check for the presence of this
                message, not just for ``qualifier.value`` being non-empty.
            timestamp_micros (int):
                The cell's stored timestamp, which also uniquely identifies
                it within its column. Values are always expressed in
                microseconds, but individual tables may set a coarser
                granularity to further restrict the allowed values. For
                example, a table which specifies millisecond granularity
                will only allow values of ``timestamp_micros`` which are
                multiples of 1000. Timestamps are only set in the first
                CellChunk per cell (for cells split into multiple chunks).
            labels (Sequence[str]):
                Labels applied to the cell by a
                [RowFilter][google.bigtable.v2.RowFilter]. Labels are only
                set on the first CellChunk per cell.
            value (bytes):
                The value stored in the cell.  Cell values
                can be split across multiple CellChunks.  In
                that case only the value field will be set in
                CellChunks after the first: the timestamp and
                labels will only be present in the first
                CellChunk, even if the first CellChunk came in a
                previous ReadRowsResponse.
            value_size (int):
                If this CellChunk is part of a chunked cell value and this
                is not the final chunk of that cell, value_size will be set
                to the total length of the cell value. The client can use
                this size to pre-allocate memory to hold the full cell
                value.
            reset_row (bool):
                Indicates that the client should drop all previous chunks
                for ``row_key``, as it will be re-read from the beginning.

                This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``row_status``.

                Indicates that the client can safely process all previous
                chunks for ``row_key``, as its data has been fully read.
