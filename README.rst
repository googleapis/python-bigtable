Preview Async Data Client
-------------------------

:code:`v2.23.0` includes a preview release of the new :code:`BigtableDataClientAsync` client, accessible at the import path
:code:`google.cloud.bigtable.data`.

The new client brings a simplified API and increased performance using asyncio, with a corresponding synchronous surface
coming soon. The new client is focused on the data API (i.e. reading and writing Bigtable data), with admin operations
remaining in the existing client.

:code:`BigtableDataClientAsync` is currently in preview, and is not recommended for production use.

Feedback and bug reports are welcome at cbt-python-client-v3-feedback@google.com,
or through the Github `issue tracker`_.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install this library in a `virtualenv`_ using pip. `virtualenv`_ is a tool to
create isolated Python environments. The basic problem it addresses is one of
dependencies and versions, and indirectly permissions.

With `virtualenv`_, it's possible to install this library without needing system
install permissions, and without clashing with the installed system
dependencies.
